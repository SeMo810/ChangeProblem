ChangeProblem
=============

Solves the Change Problem using Python.

The program takes two arguments, the first being the amount of money we need to make change for, and the second being the highest denomination coin allowed (in cents).

The denomination needs to be one of (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100). Any other value will break the program. The first input should be in the form of cents.
